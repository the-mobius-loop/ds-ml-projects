# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple **Data Science (DS)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** projects using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each project is self-contained in its own folder, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling (regression and classification). The structure allows for easy addition of new DS/ML projects.

## Projects
- **1. Insurance Analysis**: A DS/ML project analyzing medical insurance costs. Includes EDA and regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict charges.
- **2. Student Performance Analysis**: A DS/ML project examining student performance data. Features EDA, regression (predict scores), and classification (predict grades) using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
- *Future DS/ML projects will be added as new subfolders.*
